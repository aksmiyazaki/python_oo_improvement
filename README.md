## Dynamic Typing
PROS:
  - Easy to work with
  - Faster dev. time

Cons:
  - May result in bugs of unexpected data types
  - Need to be aware of type()

## Strings
  - Ordered sequences.
  - Can be treated as Arrays.
  - Strings are immutable objects

## String printing
  - .format()
    - print("This is a string {}".format("INSERTED"))
    - print("The {2} {1} {0}".format('fox', 'brown', 'quick'))
    - print("The {q} {b} {f}".format(f='fox' ,b='brown', q='quick'))
    - Float Formating:
      - print("The result was {r:2.5f}".format(r=result))
  - f-strings (formatted string literals)
    - print(f"Hello, his name is {name}")
